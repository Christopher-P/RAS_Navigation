RAS_Navigation

Purpose
=======

RAS_Navigation is a set of systems that allows a turtlebot3 to navigation around the world. This is done by utilizing `Cartographer`_ for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (`SLAM`_). The navigational system is setup to go to a certain point on the map by either listeing to the setGoal topic or through the use of the action library.
